English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family,
with its earliest forms spoken by the inhabitants of early medieval England.


As is typical of an Indo-European language,
English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment.
Unlike other Indo-European languages though,
English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions.
Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class.
